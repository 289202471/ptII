2. Browse to c:\hyvisual-2.2beta_setup
3. Select all
   It is critical that the files end up on the cd in the top
   level directory so that the autorun file is visible as 
   d:\autorun.inf.
   d:\hyvisual-2.2beta_setup\autorun.info will _not_ work.

  items
  If you do not hava a File and Folder tasks, then try using

6. Select Copy
   This will create a temporary folder that has the files
7. Browse to 'My Computer', right click on DVD/CD-RW Drive (d:)

   (Or click on the ballon in the that pops up in the task bar)
