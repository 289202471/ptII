	    Authorization Service Infrastructure for the Internet of Things: The challenges for security of the Internet of Things (IoT) make it difficult to directly apply existing security measures to the IoT. These challenges include heterogeneity, operation under open environment and scalability. In our work, we propose authorization service infrastructure for the IoT. This infrastructure consists of an open-source local authorization entity and software components called accessors, for accessing the authorization service provided by the local authorization entity. The local authorization entity is designed to embrace heterogeneous security requirements and scale well with resource-constrained devices. The accessors in our infrastructure enable developers to integrate security into IoT applications in an error-free way. We also perform security analysis and experiments to evaluate our proposed authorization service infrastructure.

	    <p>PILOT: An Actor-Oriented Learning and Optimization Toolkit for Building Swarm Applications.</p>
	    <blockquote>
	      <p>"The rapid growth of networked smart sensors today offers unprecedented volumes of continually streaming data. This renders most classical control and optimization techniques that are based on monolithic approaches ineffective for cloud-based large scale application design for the IoT. We present PILOT (Ptolemy Inference, Learning, and Optimization Toolkit), an actor-oriented machine learning and optimization toolkit that is designed for developing data-intensive distributed applications for sensor networks. PILOT presents an actor interface that enables developing complex learning and optimization tasks for large scale sensor networks in a scalable and state-space aware fashion. We demonstrate key capabilities of the toolkit with a cloud-based cooperative mobile robot target tracking scenario, and study how the framework achieves design and implementation of control policies by including higher-level abstractions of learning and optimization tasks as part of the system design."</p>
