Assume a point mass $m$ at radius $r$ from a pivot point attached by a massless arm with length $r$.
The angle of the arm is $\theta$, a function of time.
The torque applied to the arm is $T$, positive in the counterclockwise direction.
The moment of inertia is given by
\[
I = m r^2 .
\]
The angular version of Newton's second law is
\[
T = I \ddot{\theta} .
\]
The torque due to gravity is given by
\[
T_g = - mrg \cos(\theta),
\]
where $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$ is the acceleration of gravity at sea level.
The net torque is $T-T_g$.
Hence,
\[
\ddot{\theta} = \frac{T}{mr^2} - \frac{g \cos(\theta)}{r} .
\]
