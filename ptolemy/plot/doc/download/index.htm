<H1>Download Ptplot 5.1</A></H1>
<h2>Downloads</h2>
Ptplot is available for download in several format.
 <br>Each of the formats contains the same functionality.
<menu>
<li> Tar and Zip files: <a href="../install.htm#tarorzip">Instructions</a>
  <menu>
  <li> <A HREF="../../ptplot5.1.tar.gz">1.52Mb Gzipped Tar File</A>
  <li> <A HREF="../../ptplot5.1.zip">1.95Mb Compressed Zip File</A>
  </menu>
<li> Windows only: <a href="setup.htm">Run the installer as an applet</a>.
<li> Windows only: Download a <a href="ptplot5_1setup.exe">4.57Mb Windows executable</a>
</menu>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Install Java, if necessary</h3>
<p>
Ptplot 5.1 requires Java 1.2 or later.
Java 1.3 is preferred.
The Ptplot 5.1 Windows installers require Java 1.3.
To run Ptplot, the Java runtime environment (JRE) is sufficient.
To run the applets in a browser, the Java plug-in is required.
The JRE is bundled with the plug-in, so downloading the plug-in
is sufficient.  To extend Ptplot with your own
Java code, the Java development kit (JDK)
or an equivalent Java development environment is required.
The JDK includes a Java compiler.
<p>
One way to determine what version of Java (if any) is installed 
is to run our
<a href="JavaVersionApplet.htm">Java Version Applet </a>, which
uses the Java 1.3 plug-in.
Another way is to run the command below to see whether
you have Java installed, and whether it is the proper version:
<pre>
java -version
</pre>
If the command cannot be found, or the version that is printed is
less than 1.3, you should install the plug-in, JRE 1.3, or JDK 1.3
<p>
Downloads:
<menu>
<li> Windows JRE: The Java runtime environment, JRE (no Java compiler): 
<a href="j2re-1_3_0_01-win.exe"><CODE>j2re-1_3_0_01-win.exe</CODE></a> (5.1Mb)

<h3>2. Install Ptplot</h3>

<menu>

<li> There are two ways to install Ptplot on Windows machines:
 
<menu>
<li> 
<a href="setup.htm">Run the installer as an applet</a>.
This applet, from
InstallShield, will install Ptplot, from Berkeley, on your machine.
</menu>
 <B>or</B>
<menu>
<li> Download a 
<a href="ptplot5_1setup.exe"> 4.57Mb Windows executable</a>, and execute it.
</menu>
If you are not planning on extending Ptplot, then you can run
Ptplot via Start-&gt;Ptolemy-&gt;Ptplot 5.1

<p> To extend Ptplot under Windows, you will also need the
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII1.0/cygwin.htm">Cygwin toolkit</a>, and then
follow the 
<a href="../install.htm">Installation Instructions</a>
to set up your build environment.

works or not by sending email to ptolemy@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu.)
<ol>

<li> Download <a href="ptplot5_1setup.jar.gz"><CODE>ptplot5_1setup.jar.gz</CODE></a> (4.21Mb)

<h2><a name="installshield_bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
The Installshield Installer has a number of bugs:
<menu>
<li> The word 'malformed' may appear in the initial installer window.
(Installshield documents this bug in their 
<a href="http://support.installshield.com/download/ipmprelnotes.asp" target="_top">Installshield Multi-platform Release Notes</a>.)
<li> The file chooser dialog is very likely to bring up a dialog
about not being able to access the A: drive.  The workaround is 
to hit Cancel. (Documented in the Installshield Release notes)
<li> By default, the Ptplot is installed in the All Users menu.
Ideally, the user would be given a choice as to whether Ptplot
was installed for the current user or in the All Users menu.
<li> The user should be prompted for where in the Start menu 
Ptplot II is installed.
<li> The size of the install may be reported as 0kb.
<li> The percent completed bars may not work.
<li> Installing a bundled JRE does not work well so we don't use it.
Installshield Multiplatform edition can be configured to download a
JVM, but the JVM gets installed in a _jvm directory and is not added
to Add/Remove Programs and the browswers can't use the plugin.  

<li> Installshield Multiplatform Edition can't update environment variables,
so the user's path is not updated to include the directory where
Ptplot is installed.
