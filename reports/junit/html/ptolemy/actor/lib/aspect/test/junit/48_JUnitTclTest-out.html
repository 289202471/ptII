WARNING: The execution aspects in this model can influence the timing of actors by delaying the 
execution, which can potentially reverse causality. There is no guarantee that actors fire at the 
time they request to be fired. 
Use Ptides for deterministic DE behavior that is not influenced by execution aspects.
