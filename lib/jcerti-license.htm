<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</p>
<p class="p3">freedom to share and change it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By contrast, the GNU General Public</p>
<p class="p3">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</p>
<p class="p3">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</p>
<p class="p3">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</p>
<p class="p3">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You</p>
<p class="p3">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</p>
<p class="p3">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</p>
<p class="p3">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</p>
<p class="p3">not price.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</p>
<p class="p3">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</p>
<p class="p3">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</p>
<p class="p3">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</p>
<p class="p3">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</p>
<p class="p3">these things.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</p>
<p class="p3">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</p>
<p class="p3">rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</p>
<p class="p3">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</p>
<p class="p3">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</p>
<p class="p3">you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</p>
<p class="p3">code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you link other code with the library, you must provide</p>
<p class="p3">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</p>
<p class="p3">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</p>
<p class="p3">it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</p>
<p class="p3">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</p>
<p class="p3">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</p>
<p class="p3">there is no warranty for the free library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, if the library is</p>
<p class="p3">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</p>
<p class="p3">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</p>
<p class="p3">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</p>
<p class="p3">introduced by others.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</p>
<p class="p3">any free program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wish to make sure that a company cannot</p>
<p class="p3">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</p>
<p class="p3">restrictive license from a patent holder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therefore, we insist that</p>
<p class="p3">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</p>
<p class="p3">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</p>
<p class="p3">ordinary GNU General Public License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This license, the GNU Lesser</p>
<p class="p3">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</p>
<p class="p3">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We use</p>
<p class="p3">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</p>
<p class="p3">libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</p>
<p class="p3">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</p>
<p class="p3">combined work, a derivative of the original library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ordinary</p>
<p class="p3">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</p>
<p class="p3">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Lesser General</p>
<p class="p3">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</p>
<p class="p3">the library.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it</p>
<p class="p3">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</p>
<p class="p3">Public License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also provides other free software developers Less</p>
<p class="p3">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These disadvantages</p>
<p class="p3">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</p>
<p class="p3">libraries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</p>
<p class="p3">special circumstances.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</p>
<p class="p3">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</p>
<p class="p3">a de-facto standard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To achieve this, non-free programs must be</p>
<p class="p3">allowed to use the library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A more frequent case is that a free</p>
<p class="p3">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this</p>
<p class="p3">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</p>
<p class="p3">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</p>
<p class="p3">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</p>
<p class="p3">free software.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</p>
<p class="p3">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</p>
<p class="p3">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</p>
<p class="p3">system.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</p>
<p class="p3">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</p>
<p class="p3">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</p>
<p class="p3">that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p>
<p class="p3">modification follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pay close attention to the difference between a</p>
<p class="p3">"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The</p>
<p class="p3">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</p>
<p class="p3">be combined with the library in order to run.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</p>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</p>
<p class="p3">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</p>
<p class="p3">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</p>
<p class="p3">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>in the event an application does not supply such function or</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>application.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>application-supplied function or table used by this function must</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If</p>
<p class="p3">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</p>
<p class="p3">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</p>
<p class="p3">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</p>
<p class="p3">sections when you distribute them as separate works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when you</p>
<p class="p3">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</p>
<p class="p3">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</p>
<p class="p3">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</p>
<p class="p3">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</p>
<p class="p3">it.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</p>
<p class="p3">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</p>
<p class="p3">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</p>
<p class="p3">collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</p>
<p class="p3">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</p>
<p class="p3">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</p>
<p class="p3">the scope of this License.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</p>
<p class="p3">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do</p>
<p class="p3">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</p>
<p class="p3">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</p>
<p class="p3">instead of to this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(If a newer version than version 2 of the</p>
<p class="p3">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</p>
<p class="p3">that version instead if you wish.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do not make any other change in</p>
<p class="p3">these notices.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</p>
<p class="p3">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</p>
<p class="p3">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</p>
<p class="p3">the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library</p>
