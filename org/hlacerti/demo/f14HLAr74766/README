DOCUMENTATION:
 
 - This folder contains the F14 HLA PRISE demo. This demo is based on the one 
   provided by MATLAB. This demo shows how we can execute distributed and
   hardware-in-the-loop simulation using PtolemyII and the PRISE platform based
   on HLA/CERTI. The co-simulation framework PtolemyII - HLA/CERTI is used for
   this demo.

 - This demo may be executed using a Ptolemy federate as stick, or the PRISE
   stick C++ federate that is connected to a the PRO FLIGHT YOKE SYSTEM
   (hardware material from the PRISE platform).

REQUIREMENTS:

 - CERTI environment installed on your computer
 - PtolemyII framework installed on your computer
 - CMAKE build system tool, to compile the PRISE-Stick C++ federate
 - C++ compiler, to compile the PRISE-Stick C++ federate

EXECUTION:

1. Make sure you had sourced the script myCERTI_env.sh provided by CERTI
2. Run the command
   $PTII/bin/vergil $PTII/org/certi/demo/f14HLAr74766/f14HLAr74766.xml
3. Open each one of the three modes and run them in the order they appear.

NOTE: You need to have the PRO FLIGHT YOKE SYSTEM (real stick) for running with the real joystick.
