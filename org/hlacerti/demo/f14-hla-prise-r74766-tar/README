DOCUMENTATION:
 
 - This folder contains the F14 HLA PRISE demo. This demo is based on the one 
   provided by MATLAB. This demo shows how we can execute distributed and
   hardware-in-the-loop simulation using PtolemyII and the PRISE platform based
   on HLA/CERTI. The co-simulation framework PtolemyII - HLA/CERTI is used for
   this demo.

 - This demo may be executed using a Ptolemy federate as stick, or the PRISE
   stick C++ federate that is connected to a the PRO FLIGHT YOKE SYSTEM
   (hardware material from the PRISE platform).

REQUIREMENTS:

 - CERTI environment installed on your computer
 - PtolemyII framework installed on your computer
 - CMAKE build system tool, to compile the PRISE-Stick C++ federate
 - C++ compiler, to compile the PRISE-Stick C++ federate

EXECUTION:

 1. Open three terminals
 2. For each terminal source the script myCERTI_env.sh provided by CERTI
 3. For each terminal, go to the 'f14-hla-prise' folder

 4. In one terminal, launch the Eclipse configured for PtolemyII
 5. Launch VERGIL, from Eclipse if you have installed from the svn
 6. From VERGIL (Ptolemy's graphical editor) opens the model f14_HLA_PRISE.xml,
    then follow the instructions to open the different Ptolemy federate models
 
 7. In another terminal, go to the 'f14-hla-prise'
 8. Run 'rtig'

 9. In another terminal, go to the 'f14-hla-prise/prise-stick' folder
10. Go to the 'f14-hla-prise/prise-stick/build' folder
11. Run 'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../ ../src/'
12. Run 'make'
13. Run 'make install'
14. Go to the folder 'f14-hla-prise/prise-stick/bin' folder
15. Run './Joystick_Fed'

16. From VERGIL, run the "Aicraft model", then run the "Autopilot model"

NOTE: 17. If you don't have the PRO FLIGHT YOKE SYSTEM (real stick), before 
running the "Autopilot model" you can open and run the "PilotStick model" that
simulates the stick command.
